        What is Data Analysis?
        It is the science that seeks to examine a data set to better understand the information it contains so that people can make informed decisions. Data analysis consists of submitting the data to a series of operations, to obtain precise conclusions that help us achieve our objectives. These operations can consist of transformations, debugging, cleaning and the correct storage of the optimized data. Currently, many industries use data analysis to draw conclusions and decide actions to implement.

        Throughout these years I have been able to work for companies in different sectors such as telecommunications, construction, transportation, mining, accounting, and oil. I have worked for very large companies and for Star-Ups. Each experience has been challenging and rewarding at the same time. I have participated in the creation of databases and data warehouse. Thanks to the work done, my clients have reported a significant improvement in decision-making, in their products and services and in the relationship with their clients.
