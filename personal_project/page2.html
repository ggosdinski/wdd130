            <h1>A little about me</h1>
            <p>I am passionate about data and its analysis. I have been working for more than 2 years in different companies as a BI Developer, that is, the person in charge of the entire data analysis process. I have experience in the necessary transformations (ETL), database queries and, above all, in the creation of reports with high-quality visuals that allow you to see your company's information in a new and innovative way that facilitates the understanding of the current market. </p>

            <p>Throughout these years I have been able to work for companies in different sectors such as telecommunications, construction, transportation, mining, accounting, and oil. I have worked for very large companies and for Star-Ups. Each experience has been challenging and rewarding at the same time. I have participated in the creation of databases and data warehouse. Thanks to the work done, my clients have reported a significant improvement in decision-making, in their products and services and in the relationship with their clients.</p>

            <p>I also love constant learning. For this reason, in addition to my university studies focused on applied technology, I have taken several courses related to Power BI, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Azure and Python, to continue learning and be up to date with the latest technologies.</p>

            <p>Finally, I also have knowledge in Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
