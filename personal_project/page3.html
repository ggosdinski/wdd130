            <h1 class="title">A little about me</h1>
            <p class="content">I am passionate about data and its analysis. I have been working for more than 2 years in different companies as a BI Developer, that is, the person in charge of the entire data analysis process. I have experience in the necessary transformations (ETL), database queries and, above all, in the creation of reports with high-quality visuals that allow you to see your company's information in a new and innovative way that facilitates the understanding of the current market. 
                Throughout these years I have been able to work for companies in different sectors such as telecommunications, construction, transportation, mining, accounting, and oil. I have worked for very large companies and for Star-Ups. Each experience has been challenging and rewarding at the same time. I have participated in the creation of databases and data warehouse. Thanks to the work done, my clients have reported a significant improvement in decision-making, in their products and services and in the relationship with their clients.
                I also love constant learning. For this reason, in addition to my university studies focused on applied technology, I have taken several courses related to Power BI, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Azure and Python, to continue learning and be up to date with the latest technologies.
                Finally, I also have knowledge in Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title2">I can help you toâ€¦</h2>
                <p>I have the experience, knowledge and skills necessary to help you maximize the profitability of your Company. Perhaps you haven't realized yet how valuable resource data is. Thanks to its correct analysis and exploitation, you will be able to achieve your commercial, growth, sales, and customer acquisition objectives.
                    My work methodology is agile, so I am able to get involved in several projects at the same time.
                    Throughout this process I will accompany you to have excellent communication and to be able to work based on your needs and requirements. Working together will be a totally profitable and beneficial experience for both of us. 
                    </p>
